# ts-polyfills -- deployment
This is where, with each push to `master`, new versions of polyfills are deployed automatically.

To use them in-browser, you can use `https://cdn.rawgit.com/nabijaczleweli/ts-polyfills/deploy/$PATH_TO_INDEX_JS`.

To install them via `typings` use `github:nabijaczleweli/ts-polyfills#deploy` to install everything or `github:nabijaczleweli/ts-polyfills/$POLYFILL#deploy` to install only one polyfill.
